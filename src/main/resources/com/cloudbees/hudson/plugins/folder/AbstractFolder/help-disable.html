    Sometimes you want to temporarily stop building a folder full of projects. For example, maybe you are in the middle
    of a large migration and you know new builds are going to fail. Or maybe the project are built every hour but you
    know that the SCM server will be down for the next 24 hours.
    <p>
    When this option is set, no new build is performed within this folder. This allows you to disable new builds without
    changing any of the build dependency chain or changing the notification set up.
